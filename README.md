Hi!

Thanks for reaching out to my profile!

I'm a Fullstack developer, who can help you with Nodejs, Reactjs, Angularjs, Nextjs, TypeScriptjs, Vuejs, Web3js, and Solidity.

Most of my past works are based on Dapps, DeFi, DAO, DEX...and I love to work more related to crypto.

**Telegram Bots**
1. Sniping Bot (EVM/Solana)
2. Trading Bot (Manual and Auto Buy and sell)
3. Customer Support Bot (Customer to Support Agent anonymous chat, adding tier1 agent to the chat, admin to view reports and chat history)
4. Text to Lipsync AI bot
5. Custom Crypto based TG bots (Freshwallets Detector, Whale Wallets Detector, Snipe Detector, New launched token detector, LP added Alert and many more...)

**Price Impact Bot** - To execute transaction with high volume is splitted into small chunks of transaction and executed consequently.
